# TicTacToe With React.js

### Create a tictactoe in React.js and Hooks (functional components)

- Design your sitemap: How many pages/views?

- Designing your wireframe: What components and where?

- Start coding your components only rendering "Hello world" on each of them (to make sure they work).

- Create a list of all the possible user and system interactions (events) that occure during runtime (for example: The user clicks on a button to start the game).

- Create a javascript functions that will handle each of those events.

- `console.log()` on each of those funtions to make sure they are being called.

- Continue...
